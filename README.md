# playwright-projector

## [English](./README) | [Japanese](./README_ja)

playwright-projector is a simple way to use [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright). When using Playwright, it is possible to use the Page Class operation as a projector by using a configuration and a scenario without being aware of the logic such as Browser/Context.

If you want to implement high-level web tests using Playwright's Core APIs, we recommend you use Playwright, because it's a simple way to try out Playwright.
